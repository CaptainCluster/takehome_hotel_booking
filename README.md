# Hotel Booking System

This repository contains the solution to the takehome assignment given by _SyncronTech_. It contains a draw.io UML class diagram, 
Java source code (mostly demonstrating relations, a singleton, inheritance, polymorphism and the APIs. It also has a main file 
to demonstrate a scenario in which a customer attempts to book an overlapping time for a hotel room. The program was also made
with some tests to ensure functionality via TDD.
